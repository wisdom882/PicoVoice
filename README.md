Hello, I am almost done with the first question of the screening.
What I am trying to do to make the UI better than the current implementation is to show one info at a time.
What I mean is that instead of showing the whole items and letting the users choose, we show the first level and
slowly guide the user to choose from less options until the last level.
In this case when the user selects the build, the OS level appears after, once selected, the package levels appears
and so on till the compute platform.
With this the user is slowly guided through a path with less distractions.

I must say some of my commits have grammatical error, this is a mistake on my path, my apologies.
I am 78% done with the project.

I am in my last semester of my degree, I am studying Computer Science and Geography.
I have been so busy with assignments and that is why I could not finish the project on time,
but I will finish it this weekend.
